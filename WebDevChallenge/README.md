Welcome all to the third challenge of ProjectX. This challenge will help you acquire and improve on your web development skills. After
completing this challenge you should have yourselves a basic understanding of how the web works and how to build web apps.

  <b>The Problem Statement :
  Build Your Own Social Network</b>
</p>

You are free to use any frameworks/libraries but you have to use git for code maintenance and hosting. You need to commit changes regularly. Looking at the commit history we 
will see how you developed your code and whether you <strong>plagiarized</strong> it or not. You are also expected to host your project on any of the free 
hosting platform like heroku. Your web app must have the below mentioned features for you to complete this challenge. 

#### The basic features your app must have to complete this challenge :
1. User Profiles (SignUp/Login)
2. Feed
3. Posts ( with Likes/comments )
4. Chats
5. Your web app must be RESTful

> *For earning bonus points* : You are free to add as many features as you like. You can take clues from existing ones and add them to your own, or even better think of <strong>something new</strong>. 
Extra features will fetch you bonus points. You are free to ask for help regarding certain technologies to any of the captains. 
I suggest all the captains to update the Resources.md for this challenge with technologies 
they are comfortable in, so that all teams can get what they want.

### Note
You will also be judged on the quality of code as well as readability. Be sure to follow industry standards which you can find out by 
checking out other open source projects. You are also expected to make documentation of all the features that you provide in the 
ReadMe file of your git repo. Keep in mind besides the points that you earn via this challenge, this is something you are doing for 
your resume too. 

I expect all teams to <strong>submit a brief description</strong> of their social network with all the features they 
wish to offer along with its name by this month end to me at *hrushikeshrohit@gmail.com*. 
The final evaluation dates will be tentatively posted.
