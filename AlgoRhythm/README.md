Welcome aboard for 2nd official challenge of ProjectX. This challenge is based on specific techniques, Algorithms and Data Structires 
that are frequently used in Competitive Programming world. At the end of the challenge you will have a way better understanding 
of the algorithmic principles and how to solve a given problem in the most optimal timeframe.

#### What you should learn :
1. Arrays
2. Strings
3. Stacks
4. Queues
5. Linked Lists
6. Binary Search
7. Quick Sort
8. Nim
9. Bit Manipulation
10. Kadane's Algorithm
11. Sprague-Grundy Theorem
12. Disjoint Set Union
13. Recursion
14. Backtracking
15. Misc (Any Random topic, can be one of the above, but need not necessarily) 

#### Challenge Format :
1. You will be given 15 questions corresponding to the above 15 topics.
2. Questions will be of **medium** difficulty.
3. You have to use your algorithmic skills and knowledge to solve the problem.
4. Each problem will have equal weightage (20).
5. Team with maximum score(out of 300) will be winner.

<h5>Note:</h5> If you are able to solve the problems during challenge using any other technique apart from the ones that mentioned above, it's 
perfectly fine.
